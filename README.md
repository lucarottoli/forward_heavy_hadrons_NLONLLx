## Introduction

This repository contains data files associated to the paper 'Predictions for Neutrinos and New Physics from Forward Heavy Hadron Production at the LHC'.

- In the directory `POWHEG_configuration` we include ... 

- In the directory `LHE_files` we include parton-level LHE files generated with these setups for both charm and bottom production at 13.6 TeV LHC. 

- In the directory `NeutrinoFluxMC` we include a set of events files containing simulated neutrinos from charm and bottom decay passing through a 1 m$^2$ area around the beam collision axis. We provide a Jupyter notebook `Analysis.ipynb` explaining the format of the provided files and containing a simple example code to plot the neutrino energy spectra.
